# Covid-19 and RNNs Math Project

This repository contains the code for my Year 3 undergraduate Maths Project at the University of Bristol, while studying Mathematics and Computer Science (MEng).

The dataset used is the "COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University" that can be obtained from the following url: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.


TensorFlow was used to apply Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to the confirmed COVID-19 cases for various countries around the world. 

UMAP plots were created to analyze what information is encapsulated within the weights of the LSTM models, while also applying Functional Principle Component Analysis.

The report that was written to disseminate the findings has been uploaded to this repository as `Math_Project_report.pdf`.
