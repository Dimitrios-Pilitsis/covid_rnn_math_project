# covid_rnn_math_project

This repository contains the code for my Year 3 Maths Project at the University of Bristol.

I am using TensorFlow to apply Recurrent Neural Networks, specifically Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to a dataset containing COVID-19 confirmed cases for various countries around the world.

UMAP plots are created to analyze what information is encapsulated within the weights of the LSTM models.
